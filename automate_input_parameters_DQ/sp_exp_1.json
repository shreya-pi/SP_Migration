    "Stored Procedure Name:": "`[dbo].[GetCustomerRentals]`",
    "Database & Schema Information:": "* Database: `sakila`\n* Schema: `[dbo]` (default schema)",
    "Purpose & Description:": "The purpose of this stored procedure is to retrieve a list of rentals made by a specific customer, including the rental ID, film title, rental date, and return date. The procedure takes the customer's ID as input and returns the related rental information in descending order by rental date.",
    "Input Parameters:": "* `@customer_id INT`: The ID of the customer for whom to retrieve rentals.",
    "Output (Return Values or Result Set):": "The stored procedure returns a result set with the following structure:\n\n| Column Name | Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `rental_id` | `INT` | Unique identifier for each rental. |\n| `film_title` | `VARCHAR(255)` | Title of the film rented by the customer. |\n| `rental_date` | `DATE` | Date when the film was rented. |\n| `return_date` | `DATE` | Date when the film is scheduled to be returned (or null if not yet returned). |\n\n**Step-by-Step Execution Breakdown:**\n\n1. The procedure starts by setting `NOCOUNT ON`, which prevents the return of row counts for each statement executed within the procedure.\n2. It then selects the specified columns (`rental_id`, `film_title`, `rental_date`, and `return_date`) from the following tables:\n        * `sakila.rental`: Rental table containing information about each rental transaction.\n        * `sakila.inventory`: Inventory table linking films to their corresponding copies in storage.\n        * `sakila.film`: Film table containing information about each film, including its title.\n3. The procedure joins these tables using the following relationships:\n        + `rental` is joined with `inventory` on the `inventory_id` column (since a rental transaction is associated with an inventory item).\n        + `inventory` is joined with `film` on the `film_id` column (since each inventory item corresponds to a specific film).\n4. The procedure filters the results by selecting only rentals made by the customer specified in the input parameter (`@customer_id`).\n5. Finally, it orders the results by rental date in descending order using the `ORDER BY` clause.\n\n**Dependencies (Tables, Views, Other SPs, Functions):**\n\nThis stored procedure depends on the following database objects:\n\n* Tables: `sakila.rental`, `sakila.inventory`, and `sakila.film`.\n* Joins with views are not used in this procedure.\n* No dependencies on other stored procedures or functions.",
    "Example Execution:": "To execute this stored procedure, you would call it by providing the customer's ID as input. For example:\n```sql\nEXEC [dbo].[GetCustomerRentals] @customer_id = 1;\n```\nAssuming `customer_id` 1 has made several rentals, the procedure would return a list of rental information for that customer, ordered by rental date in descending order.",
    "Error Handling & Logging:": "This stored procedure does not include any explicit error-handling mechanisms or logging features. However, since it only relies on SQL operations, it is unlikely to throw errors unless there are issues with the input parameters or underlying database structure. In case of an error, you can use TRY-CATCH blocks in your application code to handle and log the error accordingly.\n\nThat's a detailed analysis of the stored procedure!"

    "Stored Procedure Name:": "`[dbo].[AddRental]`",
    "Database & Schema Information:": "* Database: `sakila` (a sample database used in various SQL tutorials)\n* Schema: `dbo` (the default schema for system tables and procedures)",
    "Purpose & Description:": "The `AddRental` stored procedure is designed to insert a new rental record into the `sakila.rental` table. It takes three input parameters: customer ID, inventory ID, and staff ID, and returns the newly generated rental ID.\n\nIn simple terms, this procedure allows users to add a new rental record by providing the necessary details (customer, inventory, and staff information). The procedure then generates a unique rental ID, which is returned as output.",
    "Input Parameters:": "* `@customer_id` (INT): The ID of the customer renting the inventory.\n* `@inventory_id` (INT): The ID of the inventory being rented.\n* `@staff_id` (INT): The ID of the staff member assisting with the rental.\n\nThese parameters are used to insert a new record into the `sakila.rental` table.",
    "Output (Return Values or Result Set):": "* `NewRentalID` (INT): The newly generated rental ID, which is returned as output.\n\nThe result set consists of a single column (`NewRentalID`) containing the generated rental ID.\n\n**Step-by-Step Execution Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Set NOCOUNT ON**: This statement sets the server to return only the number of rows affected by T-SQL statements, rather than the full message.\n2. **Declare variables**: The procedure declares two variables:\n        * `@rental_id` (INT): to store the newly generated rental ID.\n        * `@rental_date` (DATETIME): to store the current date and time using `GETDATE()`.\n3. **Insert rental record**: The procedure inserts a new record into the `sakila.rental` table using the provided input parameters (`customer_id`, `inventory_id`, `staff_id`) and the generated `rental_date`. The `return_date` is set to `NULL`, indicating that the rental has not yet been returned.\n4. **Get SCOPE_IDENTITY**: After inserting the record, the procedure uses `SCOPE_IDENTITY()` to retrieve the newly \ngenerated `rental_id`.\n5. **Return NewRentalID**: Finally, the procedure returns the generated `rental_id` as output.\n\n**Dependencies (Tables, Views, Other SPs, Functions):**\n\n* `sakila.rental`: The table into which the new rental record is inserted.\n* `GETDATE()`: A system function used to retrieve the current date and time.",
    "Example Execution:": "```sql\nEXEC [dbo].[AddRental]\n    @customer_id = 123,\n    @inventory_id = 456,\n    @staff_id = 789;\n```\nThis example execution adds a new rental record for customer ID 123, inventory ID 456, and staff member ID 789. The procedure returns the newly generated rental ID as output.",
    "Error Handling & Logging:": "* The procedure does not include explicit error handling mechanisms.\n* However, the `SET NOCOUNT ON` statement ensures that only the necessary information is returned to the client.\n* If an error occurs during execution (e.g., due to a constraint violation or data type mismatch), it will be propagated to the caller and can be handled using standard SQL error handling practices.\n\nOverall, this stored procedure provides a simple yet efficient way to add new rental records to the `sakila.rental` table."
